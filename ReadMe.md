# Cal Counter

The goal of this mobile app is to allow a User to track their Nurtition Values and Calories to achieve a better lifestyle.

User can selects goals such as maintaining weight, gaining or loosing. They can then add foods to their day by either searching for food or scanning barcodes. This allows for a simple user experience

This Project is based on React Native with Expo. It uses both the OpenFoodFacts API as well as FoodData Central API.

As a Backend Service I will be using Firebase, since it's the perfect fit for such a small application
